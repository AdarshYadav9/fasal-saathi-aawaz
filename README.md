- **NumPy & Pandas** for data processing
- **Custom CNN models** for soil analysis and pest detection

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Modern web browser with Web Speech API support

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-git-url>
cd smart-crop-advisory

# Install dependencies
npm install 
# for all the dependencies 

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📱 PWA Installation

The app can be installed as a PWA on mobile devices:
1. Open the app in your mobile browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Install the app for offline access

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

Currently supports:
- **English** - Primary interface language
- **Hindi (हिंदी)** - Full translation support
- **Punjabi (ਪੰਜਾਬੀ)** - Full translation support

## 🎨 Design System

The app uses a custom agricultural-themed design system:
- **Color Palette**: Earth tones and nature-inspired colors
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts optimized for low-literacy users
- **Components**: Custom variants of shadcn components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with larger touch targets

### Key Features Implementation

#### Voice Interface
- Uses Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis
- Supports multiple languages (Hindi, Punjabi, English)
- Visual feedback during voice interactions

#### Offline Functionality
- Service Worker caches essential resources
- Local storage for user preferences
- Sync functionality when connection is restored

#### Mock Data & AI
Current implementation uses mock data for:
- Crop recommendations (rule-based algorithm simulation)
- Pest detection results (placeholder CNN model responses)
- Market prices (static JSON data simulating e-NAM API)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Backend Integration (Phase 2)
```python
# Django models example
class CropRecommendation(models.Model):
    location = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    soil_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    crop_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    season = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    confidence_score = models.FloatField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class PestDetection(models.Model):
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='pest_images/')
    detected_issue = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    confidence = models.FloatField()
    treatment_advice = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### API Integrations
- Weather API for real-time data
- Soil data APIs
- e-NAM market price API
- Government agricultural schemes API

### AI/ML Enhancements
- Real CNN model for pest detection
- Advanced recommendation algorithms
- Predictive analytics for crop yield

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with Vite's tree shaking
- **Images**: Lazy loading and WebP format support
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching strategy for offline use
- **Network**: Handles poor connectivity gracefully

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Input validation for all user inputs
- XSS protection with proper escaping
- CSP headers for production deployment
- Secure API endpoints (when backend is implemented)

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)
1. **Lovable Platform**: Direct deployment from Lovable interface
2. **Vercel/Netlify**: Connect GitHub repository for auto-deployment

### Self-Hosted Options
```bash
# Using Node.js
npm run build
npm run preview

# Using Docker (example)
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist ./dist
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "preview"]
```
